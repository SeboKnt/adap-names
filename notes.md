# How to use

npm run build
npm run test:b01 # for exercise B01


/src
- Contains the files you need for the homework, e.g.
    src/adap-b01/names/Name.ts
-  We grade only the work done in the respective subfolder
    Changes to any other files be used in grading (we ignore them so don’t rely on them)
    
/test
- Contains public test files, e.g.
    test/adap-b01/names/Name.test.ts
